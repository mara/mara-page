Mara Page documentation
=======================

Welcome to Mara Pageâ€™s documentation. This is one of the core modules of the `Mara Framework <https://github.com/mara>`_
offering a minimal API for defining pages of Flask-based backends independently from the actual backend infrastructure.

When a web app is spread across many independent Flask blueprints, then this library can be used to add

* navigation entries
* page titles
* resource-based ACL protection
* page-specific CSS and JS files
* without having access to a global layout or the Flask app.

The library provides a drop-in werkzeug ``Response`` class that is enriched with additional information that a backend can use to render the final html page.
